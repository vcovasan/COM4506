What was the system?

The Manoeuvre Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was to automatically
correct excessive deviations from the desire aircraft attitude. This was developed
in response to a tragic plane crash on 29/10/18.

How did the system fail?

Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor failure resulted in mismatched sensor readings,
which in turn, led to an unwarranted MCAS intervention. The increasing rate of this 
intervention ultimately overwhelmed the flight crew resulting in the crash.

Had there been any prior warnings?

Yes. Prior to both crashes, a 737 MAX 8 Lion Air flight experienced similar issues.

What part of the system caused the failure?
A faulty AOA sensor caused the failure.

How could the failure have been prevented?

An investigation into the cause of the identical sensor failures. Testing of the MCAS system 
under non-ideal conditions.
